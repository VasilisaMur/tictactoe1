            <p>Tic-tac–toe is a logical game between two opponents on a square field of 3x3 cells or larger (up to an "infinite field").
                One of the players plays with "crosses", the second — with "zeros". The traditional Chinese game uses black and white stones.
            </p>
            <p>Of course, tic-tac–toe is one of the oldest logic games. But very little is known about the history of its origin.
                One of the most common versions says that the famous game came to us from the east, most likely from Japan or China.
                In favor of this version, its similarity with the game "gomoku", as well as with "renju", speaks.
                However, analogs of "tic-tac–toe" can also be found in the cultural traditions of other peoples - for example, it is known that ancient Vikings had fun with such fun.
                In each country, the game has its own untranslatable name, for example, in the USA it is called "Tic-tac-toe", and in pre-revolutionary Russia a similar game was called "Savvy".

            <div class="header-h3"><h3>Rules of the game</h3></div>
            <p>The rules of the game are known to everyone: players take turns placing 3x3 (or 5x5, depending on the size of the field) fields on free cells
                signs (one is always crosses, the other is always noughts). The first one who lined up 3 of his figures vertically,
                horizontally or diagonally, wins. The first move is made by the player putting crosses.
                Also, the player must always follow two rules that take precedence over all others:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>If a player can win immediately, he does it.</li>
                <li>If a player cannot win immediately, but his opponent could win immediately by making a move to some cell, the player himself makes a move to this cell, preventing an immediate loss.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Usually, at the end of the game, the winning side crosses out its three signs (zeros or crosses), which make up a solid row.</p>

        <div class="facts">
            <div class="header-h3"><h3>Interesting facts</h3></div>
            <ol class="pills">
                <li>Algorithms are well-known for each of the parties that guarantee a draw for any opponent's game, and if he makes a mistake, they allow him to win. Thus, the game is in a state of "no man's death".</li>
                <li>The game has many fans of all ages. But the limited number of combinations is the main reason why adults usually prefer more complex logic games.</li>
                <li>The easiest way to complicate the game is to expand the boundaries of the playing field. It can be a square with sides 5x5, 9x9, 15x15. However, on a relatively small field, the number of combinations still remains quite limited, and on an infinitely huge one, the game usually drags on and becomes boring.</li>
                <li>In pre-revolutionary Russia, the name of the fun was associated with two letters of the alphabet: "X" and "O". They were pronounced respectively as "her" and "it", and the usual fun itself was called "heriki-oniki".</li>
                <li>There are "street" "tic-tac-toe" located on playgrounds. As a rule, this is a series of vertical or horizontal rods on which 9 cubes are strung with symbols printed on them.</li>
                <li>In Russia, a 3D version of the game was released, which has no analogues in the world yet. A three-dimensional cubic matrix with cells in which balls of two colors are embedded allows players to easily navigate in three-dimensional space. Thanks to the collapsible three-tier design, you can first master the "flat" version of the game, and then complicate the rules.</li>
